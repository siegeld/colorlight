## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Re-enable Art-Net direct pixel writes
- Add serial console support documentation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **General-purpose panel configuration** - Support for multiple panel types via `--panel` argument
  - 96x48 (default), 128x64, 64x32, 64x64 panels supported
  - Configurable scan rates (1/16, 1/24, 1/32)
- **build.sh enhancements**
  - `--panel` argument to select panel type at build time
  - Automatic test image generation with correct panel dimensions
- **gen_test_image.py** - New script to generate panel-specific test patterns
  - Horizontal lines at key rows (top, middle, bottom)
  - Vertical lines at evenly spaced columns (colored: RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, MAGENTA)
  - Diagonal X pattern (CYAN and MAGENTA) for visual alignment verification

### Changed
- hub75.py now accepts `columns`, `rows`, `scan` parameters instead of hardcoded values
- colorlight.py uses PANELS configuration dictionary for panel definitions
- Row addressing properly wraps using Migen conditional logic instead of Python modulo

### Fixed
- Row wrap-around calculation using proper Migen signal expressions

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added
- Initial working release with telnet support
- LiteX SoC with VexRiscv CPU at 40MHz
- Standard LiteEth MAC with smoltcp TCP/IP stack in firmware
- Telnet management console on port 23
- ICMP ping support
- Art-Net UDP receiver (palette updates)
- HUB75 display driver supporting 8 outputs, 4 panels per chain
- Full-color (24-bit) and indexed (8-bit) display modes

- Docker-based build environment
- Support for Colorlight 5A-75E rev 8.2

### Fixed
- TCP socket state machine - changed `&` to `&&` in listen/bind conditions
- Timing in main loop - added proper delay for smoltcp timestamp handling
- MAC address consistency - use fixed MAC matching hardware default
- PAC imports for new svd2rust structure

### Changed
- Switched from custom SmolEth to standard LiteEth for better compatibility
- Reorganized repository structure, moved old projects to `legacy/`

### Known Issues
- Flash boot requires TFTP on rev 8.2 (flash chip definition mismatch)
- Art-Net direct pixel writes disabled pending testing
